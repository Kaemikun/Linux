-----process management----- 

first process is init/systemd and it does not have any parent demon ----> process which are started with system and keep running demon never dies 

 ps :- 

ps ------- > means process status 

if we don't pass any argument then it shows processes related to current session 


 

ps -e  -------> everything it shows all the process  

 


a process that is not associated with terminal will show ? in tty field 

ps -f -------> full form 

 


UID   UserId/ User Name 

PID   Process ID (Every Process has Unique ID) 

 

 

PPID     Parent Process ID 

Time --> CPU Utilization Time Stime ---> start time c ----> cpu usage % 

processes related to a perticular user ps -u username 

process with name  

 


I want to know process of id of perticular command 

ps -aux 

all user extra , Shows a detailed listing of all processes running on the system, including those started by other  

users, and additional information about each process. 

ps -t terminal to show all the processes related to a specific terminal  

 


ps -G groupId   ----> to show all process related to groupId 

ps -C commandname   -----> to show all process related to a perticular command 

ps -l  ----> longform shows additional info about each process 

 


F         ------> The process's flags or state. 

UID      -----> The user ID of the process owner. 

PID       -----> The process ID of the process. 

PPID      ---->The parent process ID of the process. 

C:           ---->The CPU utilization of the process. 

PRI:       ---->The priority of the process. 

NI:       ----->The nice value of the process. 

ADDR:   ---> The memory address of the process. 

SZ:          ---> The size of the process in memory (in kilobytes). 

WCHAN: --> The name of the kernel function that the process is waiting on. 

TTY:        ---> The terminal that the process is running on. 

TIME:   ----->The CPU time used by the process. 

CMD:    ----->The command that started the process. 

ps -r   ----> view all the running processes 

ps --ppid PPID  ------> process related to parent process id 

here I am creating a compressed archieve of all files and folders inside 

pictures folder using bzip2 compression algo 

then suspending or stopping the job then moving that job in background  

bg         -----> will move last job in background bg %+   -----> will move last job in background bg % -   -----> will move last to last job in background bg %n   -----> will move nth job in background  

 

kill :- 

kill pid   ----> kill process kill -9 pid   ----> focefully terminate  

kill -STOP  pid  ----->  to stop/pause a process kill -CONT pid  -----> to start/resume a process  

 killall :- 

using killall command we can kill a process by name 

-r  ----> we can use regular expression 

-v ----> verbose 

-i  ----> intrective  

-I  ----> ignore case  ( capital i)  

 

 

10. Top :- 

 

 

------->   Uptime    , user count , load average ,  

------->  cpu count ( press 1 to check other cpus ), user process, system                         process, nice value, idle, 

                        hardware intrupt, system interrupt, stolen time     3    ------->   free 

Res ----> reserved memory Virt -----> virtual memory 

Shr  -----> shared memory 

S ----> running , stopped , idle etc 

Press u ----> enter username 

K   ----> kill  

‘M’ to sort by memory usage 

‘P’ to sort by CPU usage 

‘N’ to sort by process ID 

‘T’ to sort by the running time 

By default, top displays all results in descending order. However, you can switch to ascending order by pressing ‘R’
