1. Creating and Managing Users 

1.1 Creating a New User: adduser 

The adduser command is the recommended way to create a new user because it is interactive and sets up user directories, shell, and group membership. 

🔍 Syntax: 

 

sudo adduser <username> 

🔍 Example: 

sudo adduser john 

This will prompt you to enter the following details: 

Password 

Full Name (optional) 

Room Number (optional) 

Work Phone (optional) 

Home Phone (optional) 

Other (optional) 

Once completed, the new user is created, and you can assign them additional privileges (e.g., adding to groups). 

 
 

1.2 Creating a User Without Interaction: useradd 

For scripting or automation, you can use useradd, which does not prompt for input. You'll need to specify all parameters, such as the home directory. 

🔍 Syntax: 

 

sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G <group> <username> 

-m: Creates a home directory for the user. 

-s /bin/bash: Specifies the user's shell. 

-G <group>: Adds the user to a group. 

🔍 Example: 

sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo john 

 
 

1.3 Setting a User's Password: passwd 

After creating a user, you can set or change their password using the passwd command. 

🔍 Syntax: 

sudo passwd <username> 

🔍 Example: 

sudo passwd john 

You'll be prompted to enter a new password for the user. 

 
 

1.4 Deleting a User: deluser 

To delete a user and optionally remove their home directory, you can use the deluser command. 

🔍 Syntax: 

sudo deluser <username> 

🔍 Example: 

sudo deluser john 

🔍 Delete the user's home directory as well: 

sudo deluser --remove-home john 

 
 

2. Managing Groups 

2.1 Creating a Group: groupadd 

You can create a new group using the groupadd command. 

🔍 Syntax: 

sudo groupadd <groupname> 

🔍 Example: 

 

sudo groupadd developers 

 
 

2.2 Adding a User to a Group: usermod 

To add a user to a group, you can use usermod with the -aG option, which appends the user to a specified group. 

🔍 Syntax: 

 

sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username> 

🔍 Example: 

 

sudo usermod -aG developers john 

This will add the user john to the developers group. The -a ensures that the user is appended to the group (without removing them from any other group). 

 
 

2.3 Removing a User from a Group: gpasswd 

To remove a user from a group, use gpasswd. 

🔍 Syntax: 

 

sudo gpasswd -d <username> <groupname> 

🔍 Example: 

 

sudo gpasswd -d john developers 

This will remove the user john from the developers group. 

 
 

2.4 Deleting a Group: groupdel 

To delete a group, use the groupdel command. 

🔍 Syntax: 

 

sudo groupdel <groupname> 

🔍 Example: 

 

sudo groupdel developers 

 
 

3. Viewing Users and Groups 

3.1 Viewing Users 

To see all users on the system, you can view the /etc/passwd file, which lists user accounts. 

🔍 Command: 

 

cat /etc/passwd 

Each line represents a user, with fields such as username, UID, GID, home directory, and shell. 

 
 

3.2 Viewing Groups 

To see all groups, you can view the /etc/group file. 

🔍 Command: 

cat /etc/group 

Each line represents a group, with fields such as group name, group password (usually x), GID, and group members. 

 
 

3.3 Check User's Groups: groups 

To see which groups a user belongs to, use the groups command. 

🔍 Syntax: 

groups <username> 

🔍 Example: 

groups john 

 
 

4. Modifying User and Group Settings 

4.1 Changing User Information: usermod 

You can modify various attributes of a user, such as their home directory, shell, or login name. 

Change a user’s home directory: 

 

sudo usermod -d /new/home/directory john 

Change a user’s login name: 

 

sudo usermod -l newname john 

4.2 Changing a Group Name: groupmod 

To rename an existing group, use the groupmod command. 

🔍 Syntax: 

sudo groupmod -n newgroupname oldgroupname 

🔍 Example: 

sudo groupmod -n dev_team developers 

 
 

5. Practical Lab Examples 

Here are some real-world tasks you can perform in your lab to reinforce the user and group management concepts: 

 
 

Example 1: Create a user and assign to a group 

Create a new user called alice: 
 
sudo adduser alice 

Create a group called admin: 
 
sudo groupadd admin 

Add alice to the admin group: 
 
sudo usermod -aG admin alice 

 
 

Example 2: Delete a user and remove their home directory 

Delete bob: 
 
sudo deluser --remove-home bob 

 
 

Example 3: Modify user settings 

Change alice’s home directory: 
 
sudo usermod -d /home/alice_new alice
